BJCP STYLE MEMORY GAME

===============================
GAME PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this game is to assist with the BJCP standards for Cicerone (or just for fun!). 
The game will start out as a "memory" type game that can be one or two person player. 

Each player will be given 1 beer and they will have to place the correct beer in the correct category 
(2/3 categories will be provided at random) in a drag and drop style. If the beer is placed correctly, then the player will score a point. 
There is a 10 second time cap per turn. The player can then move on to the next beer & category option, which will be at random. 
The player has 3 tries to get the beer in the correct category per level. If 3 attempts are exhausted, then the game is over. 
If the player completes all the categories correctly, they can move on to the next level.

If the game is two person, all of the other rules apply. Whomever scores the most points win.
